<H3>What is Anencephaly?</H3>

<P>Anencephaly is a neural tube defect (a disorder involving incomplete 
development of the brain, spinal cord, and/or their protective coverings). 
The neural tube is a narrow sheath that folds and closes between the 3rd 
and 4th weeks of pregnancy to form the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. 
Anencephaly occurs when the "cephalic" or head end of the neural tube fails 
to close, resulting in the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, 
and scalp. Infants with this disorder are born without both a forebrain 
(the front part of the brain) and a cerebrum (the thinking and coordinating 
area of the brain). The remaining brain tissue is often exposed--not covered 
by bone or skin. The infant is usually blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable 
to feel pain. Although some individuals with anencephaly may be born with a 
rudimentary brain stem, the lack of a functioning cerebrum permanently rules 
out the possibility of ever gaining consciousness. Reflex actions such as 
respiration (breathing) and responses to sound or touch may occur. The cause 
of anencephaly is unknown. Although it is believed that the mother's diet 
and vitamin intake may play a role, scientists believe that many other factors 
are also involved.</P>

<H3>Is there any treatment?</H3>

There is no cure or standard treatment for anencephaly. Treatment is supportive. 

<H3>What is the prognosis?</H3>

The prognosis for individuals with anencephaly is extremely poor. If the 
infant is not stillborn, then he or she will usually die within a few hours 
or days after birth. [Editor's Note: The unborn child may have been diagnosed 
as having anencephaly, but be born with a less severe form of the disease, 
allowing the infant to live for years or more]

<H3>What research is being done?</H3>

The The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke conducts and 
supports a wide range of studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal 
brain development. The knowledge gained from these fundamental studies 
provides the foundation for understanding how this process can go awry and, 
thus, offers hope for new means to treat and prevent congenital brain 
disorders including neural tube defects such as anencephaly.
