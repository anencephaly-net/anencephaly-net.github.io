despite the child's fatal condition. While many tips come from personal

<P><A href="http://www.anencephalie-info.org/">Anencephaly
  Information</A> - Anencephaly is a congenital malformation that occurs in
approximately one in one thousand pregnancies. Anencephaly is a neural tube
defect, just as is spina bifida. Life expectancy for an anencephalic baby is
just a few hours, sometimes a few days at most.  As the malformation is usually
detected during a pre-natal scan, parents are often confronted with a choice
between life and death. A choice made with very little information of what is
in store for them. It is with this in mind that we have made the choice to
share the stories of the brief, but wonderful lifes of our anencephalic babies.
I hope that it will be of help to you and impart courage.</P>
