<P>To My Sweet Angel, Mary Elizabeth</P>

<P>I see you in the sunset, I see you in the tiny clouds,<BR>
I don't know why you were taken;<BR>
I can only trust the One who has you in His<BR>
tender loving care and capable Hand.<BR>
I will never forget your face, your sweet innocence,<BR>
or your strong will to live.<BR>
You are forever my child, and I LOVE YOU!</P>

<P><EM>Our little angel, Mary Elizabeth, we miss you so much.<BR>
Love, Mommy, Daddy, and big brother, Joshua</EM></P>

<P><STRONG>I'M EVERYPLACE</STRONG></P>

<P>Mom don't mourn for me<BR>
I'm still here,though you don't see<BR>
I'm right by your side each night and day<BR>
And within your heart I long to stay</P>

<P>My body is gone but I'm always near<BR>
I'm everything you feel, see or hear<BR>
My spirit is free, but I'll never depart<BR>
As long as you keep me alive in your heart</P>

<P>I'll never wander out of your sight<BR>
I'm the brightest star on a summer night<BR>
I'll never be beyond your reach<BR>
I'm the warm moist sand when you're at the beach</P>

<P>I'm the colourful leaves when fall comes around<BR>
And the pure white snow that blankets the ground<BR>
I'm the beautiful flowers of which you're so fond<BR>
The clear cool water in a quiet pond</P>

<P>I'm the first bright blossom you'll see in spring<BR>
The first warm raindrop that April will bring<BR>
I'm the first ray of light when the sun starts to shine<BR>
And you'll see that the face in the moon is mine</P>

<P>When you start thinking there's no one to love you<BR>
You can talk to me through the Lord above you<BR>
I'll whisper my answer through the leaves on the trees<BR>
And you'll feel my presence in the soft summer breeze</P>

<P>I'm the hot salty tears that flow when you weep<BR>
And the beautiful dreams that come while you sleep<BR>
I'm the smile you see on a baby's face<BR>
Just look for me,mom, I'm everyplace...</P>

<P>Dearest Mommy,<BR>
When you wonder the meaning<BR>
of life and love<BR>
Know that I am with you<BR>
Close your eyes and feel me kissing you<BR>
in the gentle breeze across your cheek</P>

<P>When you begin to doubt that you shall ever see me again<BR>
Quiet your mind and hear me<BR>
I am in the whisper of the heavens<BR>
Speaking of your love</P>

<P>When you lose your identity<BR>
When you question who you are<BR>
where you are going<BR>
Open your heart and see me<BR>
I am the twinkle in the stars<BR>
smiling down upon you<BR>
Lighting the path for your journey</P>

<P>When you awaken each morning<BR>
Not remembering your dreams<BR>
But feeling content and serene<BR>
Know that I was with you<BR>
Filling your night with thoughts of me</P>

<P>When you linger in the remnant pain<BR>
Wholeness seeming so unfamiliar<BR>
Think of me<BR>
Know that I am with you<BR>
Touching you thru the shared tears of a gentle friend<BR>
Easing the pain</P>

<P>As the sunrise illuminates the desert sky<BR>
In that breathtaking brilliance, awaken your spirit<BR>
Think of our time together, all too brief, but ever brilliant<BR>
When you were certain of us, together<BR>
When you were certain of your destiny</P>

<P>Know that God created that moment in time,<BR>
Just for us<BR>
I am with you always.<BR>
