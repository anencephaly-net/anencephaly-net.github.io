<P>
We were very surprised to find out via ultrasound at 9
weeks pregnant that our baby had anencephaly.  We were
scared but chose to love our baby fully.  Little did we
know just how much we would come to love our baby and just
how much a blessing she was.  She was the ultimate gift
from God!  Many people have much sympathy and feel sorry
for us, but we feel so lucky and blessed.  This baby was so
darn precious!
</P>

<P>
We welcomed our bundle of joy on Tuesday, March 20th, 2012
at 2:09pm!
</P>

<P>
My husband and I held her in our arms as she was welcomed
into heaven at 4:30am on Wednesday, March 21st!
</P>

<P>
Paige Frances was such a beautiful baby!  She was such a
joy and such a blessing!  She did so well during her time
here!  We are so proud and honored to be her mother and
father!
</P>

<P>
Although we greatly wanted more time with her, God gave us
the time we needed with her.  She was born vibrant and very
alive.   Paige was very pink at birth.  Immediately she
started making sweet, strong noises.  How amazing it was to
hear those noises.  She continued to coo and make sweet
noises throughout most of the day.
</P>

<P>
Many of our family and friends were at the hospital for her
birth and we proudly showed her off.  Our priest came and
baptized her in our recovery room.  At 12:30am on Wednesday
I held her skin to skin for almost 3 hours.  I will never
forget how precious and special those 3 peaceful hours I
had with her were.  During that time Daddy was sleeping,
but then I woke him up so I could rest for a bit.  He was
then able to hold her skin to skin for over an hour and he
will always treasure that time.  About 4:20am Paige let out
a few strong cries, the first time she actually cried.  She
was letting us know that Jesus was about to call her home.
At that point Daddy and Paige joined me in my bed and he
and I held her together as she breathed her last breath and
her little heart beat its last beat.  She went fast, she
went peacefully.  For that we are very thankful.  Yes, it
was very tough to hold our daughter in our arms and watch
her pass from this life, but at the same time we felt so
much love and felt a great peace after a bit.  We cannot
even describe how much we loved and of course continue to
love Paige.  We would do it all over again!  She was so
worth it!
</P>

<P>
Paige truly was beautiful.  She was born at 37 1/2 weeks
via c-section. She was 19 in. long and weighed 4lbs. 9oz.
She had perfect feet and hands.  Her lips, nose, cheeks and
ears were as cute as could be.  Occasionally she would open
her right eye and show off her sparkling blue eye.  Her
left eye was protruding so we kept an eye patch over it.
We kept a hat on her head as most of the top of her head
had exposed brain tissue.  Although her eye and top of head
definitely looked different, when we saw her without the
hat and eye patch, we were not frightened by it.  She truly
was beautiful.
</P>

<P>
We chose to donate any organs possible.  We were able to
donate her liver to be used for Liver Cell Therapy.  The
liver cells are used for children 0 - 5 years who need
liver transplants.  The Liver Cell Therapy is used to keep
these children alive until they are old enough and strong
enough to receive a liver transplant.
</P>

<P>
We had a full Catholic funeral mass for Paige and buried
her in a local cemetary.  It was a very nice service.  We
now look forward to one day being able to meet up with our
precious child in heaven.
