<H2>Our Story</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>We were excited when we found out about Patricia being pregnant again - we
had had a miscarriage during a prior pregnancy. We were also in the midst of
raising Joshua, a strong willed two year old. Since Joshua was taken via
c-section at 37 weeks due to Patricia's toxemia and also because of the
miscarriage, Patricia was watched by her doctor very carefully. We were able to
agree on names for the baby early - Christopher Thomas or Mary Elizabeth.</P>

<IMG src="images/baby1.jpg" align="right" alt="[UltraSound at 12 Weeks]">

<P>The baby was due on September 9, 1998. About 18 weeks into the pregnancy,
the doctor did an AFP test, and the result came back abnormal. The doctor
explained that there are two reasons for this. Either the due date is
miscalculated or the baby could have a neural tube defect. She sent us to have
an ultrasound to verify the due date.</P>

<P>The ultrasound took place on April 15, 1998. I went with Patricia and
Joshua, and we looked forward to early glimpses of our baby. Patricia wanted to
know the babies sex, but I did not. However, we were not expecting the doctor
to inform us that the baby had anencephaly. It was quite a shock.</P>

<P>We asked the doctor what to do next. He said that most people terminate the
pregnancy, because they consider the baby to be non-viable. However, we knew
that there was a life in there, and knew that we should give her every chance
to live. When we discussed this with our doctor, she agreed and also arranged
for a second ultrasound.</P>

<P>Before the second ultrasound, we began researching anencephaly and neural
tube defects, and praying that the first ultrasound was wrong. The internet
served as a very useful tool for doing research. By the time the second
ultrasound rolled around, we were knowledgeable about the subject. However, the
second ultrasound revealed nothing new - the baby's brain had not formed. We
still prayed for a miracle. The ultra sound did reveal that the baby was a
girl. We could now pray for our Mary Elizabeth.</P>

<P>After the second ultrasound, our doctor informed us of our options, and we
told her that we would continue the pregnancy to term. Our doctor told us that
she would treat the pregnancy as a normal pregnancy, and would provide us with
normal care, so that we would not feel different.</P>

<IMG src="images/baby2.jpg" align="left" alt="[UltraSound at 22 Weeks]">

<P>We spent quite a few nights and weekends studying about anencephaly, and
eventually found grief and support group information. Patricia also found
several people via the internet that had had an anencephalic child, and began
corresponding with them. The site that had the most helpful information was the
<A href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120918214702/http://www.asfhelp.com//">Anencephaly Support Foundation</A>, which
contained information, personal stories, and medical articles about the
neural-tube defect of anencephaly. It also helped us prepare for the eventual
day when Mary Elizabeth would be born.</P>

<P>We packed a suitcase with our camera, extra film, our camcorder, extra
tapes, a plaster hand print kit, some baby outfits, a doll, a baby book, and a
bible. Patricia also packed a suitcase for herself. Twice prior to delivery
Patricia started to feel bad, and as a precaution, the doctor sent us to the
emergency room for observation. We were able to get familiar with the hospital.
Three weeks prior to full term, after the second visit to the emergency room,
Patricia was placed on bed rest. Her mother came from nearby Alabama to help
around the house.</P>

<P>The next checkup at the doctor's office at two weeks prior to term, the baby
was monitored by ultrasound. It was discovered then that the baby was breech.
The doctor set up a c-section for the following week, 1 week prior to full
term. Another ultrasound at 2 days prior to the c-section showed no change in
the baby's presentation. We showed up at the hospital on Thursday morning,
September 3, 1998, ready for the c-section.</P>

<P>Mary Elizabeth was born at 9:49 a.m., and struggled to breath. As she lay in
the warmer with doctors hovering over her, she cried out, and started to
breath. The neonatologist didn't think she would make it very long, so I picked
her up and carried her to Patricia. Patricia was still finishing surgery, but
held her next to her face. G. K. Abner, the pastor of Patricia's mom's church,
gave us a blessing together, and then we took Mary Elizabeth to the special
care nursery. We took a few pictures as they began to clean her up, and the
nurse told me I could come back in about 30 minutes, when they were
finished.</P>

<IMG src="images/mary1.jpg" align="right" alt="[Dad and Mary - newborn]">

<P>I went back up to the waiting room, and found Joshua, Patricia's family, G.
K. Abner, and Fr. Gordy. I started to tell Joshua about his sister, and broke
down into tears. I showed him the Polaroid photo of her, and explained that her
head was broken. It was very difficult. I then went to find Patricia, and she
was still in the operating room. I went in and told her how things were going,
and helped take her to the recovery room. I then called my mom and dad to let
them know about our baby.</P>

<P>While waiting in the recovery room, the special care nurse brought Mary
Elizabeth to us. She was dressed in a beautiful blue dress, and had a bandage
on her head. Patricia held her, and Fr. Gordy baptized her in a very touching
ceremony. We took a family picture. After taking our belongings to our room, I
went to the special care nursery where I spent most of the day with her.
Patricia joined me as soon as she was released from the recovery room.</P>

<IMG src="images/mary2.jpg" align="left" alt="[Dad, Mom, and Mary, after her Baptism]">

<P>Mary Elizabeth was normal except for the top of her head. She even had hair
at the base of her head! She was very active, and held onto our fingers
immediately. She liked being held, and opened only one of her eyes. She would
jump at loud sounds, and would often root when hungry. The nurse had placed a
feeding tube in her to feed her, and she was fed at regular intervals. We
signed a DNR order, but requested that she be kept comfortable and fed.</P>

<P>During the day, Joshua came to visit her, and sang her a song. It went,
"Hush little baby don't say a word. Mommy's gonna buy you a mockingbird."
Joshua finished it out with, "If that diamond ring won't shine, mommy's gonna
buy you a model train!" Joshua had picked out a doll for her, and it stayed in
her bassinet.</P>

<IMG src="images/mary3.jpg" align="right" alt="[Dad, Mom, Joshua and Mary, after her Baptism]">

<P>I had to leave her at 6:30 p.m. for shift change, and I laid her in the
bassinet. The nurse suggested I lay her on her belly. I did, and she started
snoring very loudly. I was alarmed at first, but realized she was only taking
after me.</P>

<P>We took a break to sleep that night, but were called back at 1:00 a.m. when
her vital signs began dropping. When we showed up and began holding her, her
vital signs improved. We stayed for several more hours before going back to get
a couple of hours of sleep. I went back to visit her prior to the 6:30 a.m.
shift change, and ate breakfast during the shift change. Patricia and I spent
the morning with her, but noticed that she wasn't responding as well as the
first day. At about 1:00 p.m., her vitals started dipping, and we took her to a
private parenting room, next to the nursery.</P>

<P>We spent the next 6 hours watching her struggle and fight to stay alive.
During this time, she would stop breathing, and then seize, and begin breathing
again. She did this about 5 times, each time getting weaker. At about 7:30
p.m., she stopped breathing, and died in Patricia's arms. During this time the
hospital chaplain, a local priest, and a deacon from our parish were by our
side.</P>

<P>Deacon Jack stayed with us after she died. We bathed her and dressed her
while we waited for the funeral home to arrive. We said good-bye at about 10:00
p.m., and went back to our room. The following day was spent arranging the
funeral, and notifying other friends and family who weren't called the night
before. Patricia was released from the hospital on Saturday, and we went home.
My parents had arrived at our house from traveling all night, and were saddened
to hear the news.</P>

<P>Sunday morning, I played guitar and led the singing at the 8:00 a.m. mass.
It was very difficult, but I managed to get through the music. Friends brought
food for us to eat during the day. The visitation and wake service were held
that evening. Deacon Jack led the service. The following morning we had the
funeral mass at St. Pius X, and had the burial the following day in Alabama.
Joshua found a couple of stones during the grave side service, and placed them
in the casket with her. We had placed a rosary (a gift from my mom), a small
white bible, a guardian angel pin that Patricia had worn during her pregnancy,
a stuffed angel bear from Aunt Denise, a porcelain angel from Patricia's Aunt
Marie, and a family photo in the casket with her.</P>

<P>We gave Mary Elizabeth's doll to Joshua, and he named it Mary Elizabeth. It
has been a great comfort to him.</P>

<HR>

<P>Steve has done a great job recounting the memories of our experience with
our beautiful Mary Elizabeth. I would like to share with you some of my
thoughts and feelings now.</P>

<P>I feel very blessed to be Mary Elizabeth's mother. I always knew that my
baby needed me to protect her and to be her voice from the time that she was
conceived. I am so very thankful that I was able to hold her and see her
beautiful face. The 34 hours that we had with her will forever be etched in my
mind as a very special time with a very special little girl. I know that my
daughter is safe and is in heaven now. I miss her terribly and would give
anything to have her here with me. I feel comfort in knowing that one day I
will hold her again in heaven. Mary Elizabeth taught me so much about love,
being humble, and thankful in all things.</P>

<P><B>Update!</B></P>
</CENTER>

<P>Patricia began taking folic acid after Mary Elizabeth's birth, and became
pregnant in the spring of 1999. Patricia gave birth to a baby girl, Anna Rose
Karg, on December 23, 1999. Anna is healthy and well, and had no defects other
than a tiny VSD causing a heart murmur, which closed by itself when she was 2
months old.  Four years later Patricia gave birth to a baby boy, Christopher. Christopher was born with a cleft palate which was corrected with surgery.</P>

Anencephaly is a congenital malformation that occurs in approximately one in
one thousand pregnancies. Anencephaly is a neural tube defect, just as is spina
bifida. Life expectancy for an anencephalic baby is just a few hours, sometimes
a few days at most. As the malformation is usually detected during a pre-natal
scan, parents are confronted with a choice between life and death. A choice
often made with very little information of what is in store for them. It is
with this in mind that I have made the choice to share the story of the brief,
but wonderful life of our anencephalic daughter, Anouk. I hope that it will be
of help to you and impart courage.</P>
